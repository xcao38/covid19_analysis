# covid19_analysis

Save lives or save economy? A quesiton that most people in the United States are asking right now beceuse of the reopen economy plan from the White House. How much of our economy will be hit? How would the crisis go? In this Covid-19 analysis, we are trying to answer 3 key questions:

- rough estimates of deterioration to GDP due to quarantining for different periods of time?

- rough estimates of deterioration to GDP due to different %s of the workforce falling ill

- rough estimates of increases in health care costs / economic damages if more of the population falls ill (think about "cliff-drop" moments such as insurance companies having to pay out more than they can, or hospitals running out of beds, or poor people without insurance having to have their treatments paid for by the government)
